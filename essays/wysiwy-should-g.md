WYSIWYG (pronounced “wiz-ee-wig” in the dialect of the aliens) is by far the longest acronym I have ever come across, derived from the very elegant and technical phrase “what you see is what you get”. Jokes aside, this is an actual term used in computing to describe the class of editors where the words or images you place on the screen are closely representative of what the final product will look like, and thus the phrase “what you see is what you get”. Microsoft Word and Google Docs are considered wysiwyg editors (I’m just gonna use lowercase since it looks more amusing) since whatever you type on screen is what the final document will look like, whereas non-wysiwyg editors like Atom and Emacs require documents to be compiled in order to produce the final end product.

Okay, cool. Now you know (or are reminded of) what wysiwyg is. So why do I bring this up? In the world of web design, user interface (UI) frameworks are very much like non-wysiwyg editors: UI frameworks support the creation of web-pages by using lines of HTML and CSS code, with the finished web-page only viewable after compilation of that code. I mean no offense to those who really enjoy this kind of from-the-ground-up style of website development, but. . . UI frameworks just isn’t good enough for the fast-paced world we live in.

(That’s an assumption of course. If you’re not from this world, I’d really like to know your thoughts on Atlantis or the Egyptian Pyramids and whether you know the folks who might have been involved...)

UI frameworks! They are not intuitive or efficient in creating awesome websites, primarily because users are typing lines of code that by some mystical means result in images and text appearing on a screen. Like non-wysiwyg editors, this complicates the process of creating a final product that can be sees as users must first code it out and compile, whereas wysiwyg editors bypass this step and allow users to edit and immediately see the resulting end product. Website builders like Wix and Squarespace are the wysiwyg editors of website design, allowing for users to directly and quickly edit page content: This includes changing the font and size of text like you’d normally expect, place and resize images and other media content, and basically do all of the tasks you could probably accomplish on a UI framework — minus the code.

Artists work with colors and textures, architects deal in blueprints and scale models, and users creating websites deal with text fonts and animated background images. Life becomes so much easier when you can see in front of you the work of your hands, which for users means being able to drag that image a little more to the left, type words directly onto the page in precisely the right spot, or use a color slider to see the immediate emotions and atmosphere created by a custom palette. At the end of the day, the best web design tools will always be the ones where what you see is what you get.


*Disclaimer:* You may have noticed that I never once said “web developer” in the entirety of my discourse. This was (mostly) intentional as it is my personal belief that web developers should in fact know the basics of HTML and CSS, and thus UI frameworks would come in handy in aiding the learning process. That being said, users who just need a website that looks nice have no real need to use UI frameworks nor understand the internal workings of HTML and CSS. <i class="square icon"></i>
