One of Meteor’s evident strengths is how quickly a developer can get an application prototype up and running, complete with background graphics, basic selection animations, and even login and account creation functionality. That being said, whenever I create a new Meteor project I am faced with that dastardly deterrent — that infamous inconvenience — every hacker’s greatest fear and annoyance: loading time.

30 seconds! Can you believe it? 30 seconds after typing the command to create a new Meteor project. And one would think that’s enough but no, there’s an additional 20 seconds to actually start the Meteor program. Could it be worse? Try editing the program. 1 MINUTE for IntelliJ to index all of the Meteor files before you can do any real file editing. Sum it up and you get almost 2 minutes. 2 minutes! Gone from my life, never to be reclaimed or redeemed.

Past students who have used Meteor say that this is normal. Good in fact. Just the starting up of a Meteor project can take up to 2 minutes alone (compared to my average 20 seconds). So I should be thankful right? Well, yeah. I should be. Not gonna lie. But griping about things every once in awhile can be healthy to.

In retrospect it seems appropriate how Meteor can enable you to create applications really fast, but first puts your patience to the test when you first begin. I imagine hackers in general are not particularly gifted when it comes to patience. Most just find something else to do while waiting, get engrossed in a side adventure, encounter another loading screen, and then notice that the task they were initially waiting for had already loaded a while back.

Try as I might, that’s really the only thing I have against Meteor, and I’m told that they are working on shortening the load time — so it will likely not be a fundamental problem with the framework. But for now, I gripe. Because I can. <i class="square icon"></i>
