When I previously attempted to answer the question of “What is a computer?” I struggled with trying to distinguish a computer from a machine. Both seemed to deal with inputs and outputs, but it appeared to me that a computer somehow did “more” with its input than a machine. The question gets more complicated when we consider that the human brain is like a computer, but somehow over time it can take the same exact input and produce different outputs. In the end, the answer to the question was that in order to define a computer, we actually require a third component besides the input and output: a program.

Programs are what ultimately separates computers from machines. When given a certain input, a machine will *always* return the same output and *only* that output given that specific input. Computers, on the other hand, can take a certain input and return all kinds of different outputs depending on which program is loaded at the time. To illustrate, consider the difference between a hammer and a multi-bit screwdriver:

By design, a hammer essentially has one set purpose of applying blunt force to an object or surface, such as pounding nails into wood. Like a machine, a hammer takes an input (swinging motion) and returns an unchanging output (pounding force). A multi-bit screwdriver, on the other hand, can achieve different tasks depending on which screwdriver bit head is attached. Like a computer, a multi-bit screwdriver takes an input (twisting motion) and a program (bit head) and returns a different output depending on which program is loaded (compatibility with different screw types).

This difference is what allows a computer to take the same input and return different outputs. If a word processing program is loaded, pressing the spacebar will type a whitespace character. With a media player program, pressing the spacebar will start or pause the movie. And if playing a video game program, pressing the spacebar will make the character jump. Three different outputs for the same spacebar input, just by switching the loaded program.

That being said, we can now go back and answer our original question: “What is a computer?” A computer is an object that takes an input and a program and returns a certain output depending on the program. We can even apply this definition to one of the most advanced and magnificent computers in existence — the human brain. What is amazing about the human brain is that it can constantly take in inputs and programs through life experience and knowledge, and over time can return an infinite number of possible output variations. In other words, the human brain writes its own programs. This is the goal that scientists are trying to achieve in the field of artificial intelligence: To create computers that can generate their own programs instead of requiring programs to be written and loaded by humans. Whether this endeavor is scientifically possible is a debate for another time. Until then remember, you are not a machine.

You are a computer. <i class="square icon"></i>
