JavaScript became the first programming language I ever learned somewhat by accident. When I was taking my first step into the world of coding, I had decided to as best as possible start with a “root” language (as in the root of a tree) and work my way up. My simplistic assumption back then was that “root” languages would have shorter names that “branching” languages would add to. This meant that C was the root language for C++ and C# (quite true) and Java was the root language for JavaScript (Haha, nice try younger me).

Anyway, a friend of mine recommended a programming tutorial site called Codecademy, claiming that it had a decent Java tutorial series. I must have been quite excited when I first logged on, because the moment the list of available courses loaded I swiftly clicked the first one that said “Java”. Had I spent maybe a half-second more, I likely would have noticed the “Script” . . .

Oh well. I was a good ways into the course before 1) I noticed the course title and 2) learned that Java and JavaScript have about as much in common as Attila the Hun and Winnie the Pooh (same middle name). Okay, not that vast of a difference, but you get the gist, and the gist is all that really matters.

I digress.

JavaScript was my first programming language and as such I had nothing to compare it to. To me it was all essentially: *“Oh, this is how you declare a variable. This is how you make a function. These are if statements. This is a for loop. Neat.”* Unfortunately, the rush of learning something new wore off and I made it maybe half-way through the tutorial series before I lost interest.

Years later I would eventually learn Java and C and a dabble of C++ and not really think much of it. And then one day by a twist of fate, I returned to JavaScript. BOOM! JavaScript was back in the game, and this time with an opponent to match up against. The comparisons came pretty quick: *“Hey! I can just create a variable without specifying a specific datatype. Nice, functions are so easy to whip up now. Whoohoo! I can use an array to store anything I want!”* On and on it would go, with JavaScript continually giving me that smug, *“Told you so. Should have finished that tutorial course kid.”*

Indeed. I am nowhere near to being a master sensei of the Script of Java. But after what I’ve been able to observe with the various conveniences and amenities that JavaScript can offer over other languages, I am compelled to continue the ultimate contest to find the one language to rule them all. May the odds be ever in JavaScript’s favor.

. . . Until a revolutionary new hotshot language arrives on the block and blows away the competition. C'est la vie. <i class="square icon"></i>
